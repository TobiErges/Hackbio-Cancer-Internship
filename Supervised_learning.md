**_**Supervised learning**_**

Supervised learning is a class of machine learning that labels tasks and data and then feeds it to a machine learning algorithm to predict certain outcomes \[1]. Typically, these models have the capacity to take these label data and extrapolate relationships between the data and expected result such that when given new information, it can accurately predict an outcome or pattern \[2]. Making it easy to be used research, particularly in cancer biology. Cancer is characterized by different changes as the disease progresses from benign to cancerous, localized to metastasis and these changes for the most part tend to be consistent across some tumor types in different patients. For example, androgen gene mutation in prostate cancer. Hence there is a need for a way to utilize the enormous data to be able to tell the differences between healthy and diseased tissues at the molecular level and proffer early treatment options.\[4]

 

Examples of supervised learning models are Linear regression, Neural networks, object detection, sentiment analysis, and decision trees. Although some of them are advanced supervised learning or may be combined with unsupervised or semi-supervised learning to increase their outputs better\[5].

Fig 1. An example of a supervised learning model, the tumors are represented with an X, and classified, wrongly labeled tumors are circled. This feedback system can also serve to correct the model for future predictions. \[2]

 

In a paper by Chris et al., 2016\[3], they used supervised learning to determine colorectal cancer classes and survival rates using cellular biology parameters. They labeled the data with parameters such as data used in classifying cancer stages; The TNM staging, using Tumor(T) size, number of nodes(N) it has metastasized to, and number of organs tumors can be detected(M) for each patient. They also included Physical data like age, immunological data like T cell types, etc. They were able to achieve a prediction rate of 55-60% which may not be sufficient for clinical use but when most of the inconsistencies in the experiment are addressed, its value may go back to a reasonable score.

 

Finally, supervised learning may not be enough in some scenarios where data cannot be labeled due to how enormous or complex the data is especially in biomedical research – cancer biology where tissue samples are heterogeneous mixtures of different cells with different gene expression patterns, each undergoing multiple physiological and molecular changes at different rates than humans can label, at this point both semi-supervised and unsupervised may be employed to increase accuracy(how sensitive, accurate and specific) levels of the output \[2,3,4]
